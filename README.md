# Facebook API Analysis


https://unhcr-mena.github.io/facebookapi/

Facebook [Marketing API](https://developers.facebook.com/docs/marketing-api/buying-api/targeting#behaviors)  allows advertisers to target audiences by demographic groups. Facebook ad campaigns have a three-level structure.

An R package [fbRads](https://github.com/daroczig/fbRads) is available to wrap the API and allow for analysis of potential audience that falls within specific targeting criteria. 

Another R package allows to conduct quota sampling via Facebook advertisements: [fbSample](https://github.com/13bzhang/fbsample). This has been used in the paper: [Quota Sampling Using Facebook Advertisements Can Generate Nationally Representative Opinion Estimates](http://qssi.psu.edu/new-faces-papers-2017/zhang-quota-sampling-using-facebook-advertisements).
